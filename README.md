# Physiological Measurement Analyser

A sample of first year male statistics students at Glasgow University had the grip strength of their dominant hand measured using a grip dynamometer. In addition, a number of physiological measurements were made on their dominant hand and arm; width and length (cm) of the hand, circumference (cm) of forearm and bicep, skinfold thickness (mm) of forearm and bicep. The height (cm) and weight (kg) of the students was also recorded.
The data are stored in the Stata data file Male grip strength.dta and contains the following variables:
| Hwid hand width | (cm) |
| Hlen hand length | (cm) |
| Fcirc forearm circumference | (cm) |
| Bcirc bicep circumference | (cm) |
| Fskin forearm skinfold | (mm) |
| Bskin bicep skinfold | (mm) |
| Grip grip strength | (kg) |
| Weight weight | (kg) |
| Height height | (cm) |
a) Use the weight and height variables to create 4 categories of BMI. (i) underweight <18.499 (ii) Normal 18.5-24.999 (iii) overweight 25-29.999 and (iv) obese >=30 and then use appropriate statistical methods to identify a parsimonious model for predicting grip
